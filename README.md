Hi, I’m Pascal! 🏳️‍🌈
🌱 I’m currently learning to get better at coding (like, in general)

Learned specialist for system integration. 
Currently working in software testing (manual and automated; with ISTQB and so on).
Besides that: Interested in hashtag new work, ai/ml, apple, music (/production), video, photo (unsplash: justneverknown), nerdy stuff.. Well basically I'm really easy to excite for new things

How to reach me? Leave me a message on t3l3gram: ntsfnnybt

(Disclaimer: Already had a GitHub account before, but it's time for a fresh start ✨)
